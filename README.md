**Machine-Learning**
Solving Real world Problems using Machine Learning Algorithms 

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.


**Types of Machine Learning** -
  
  1. SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
  2. UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
  3. REINFORCEMENT MACHINE LEARNING


**SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING**-Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias). This statistical quality of an algorithm is measured through the so-called generalization error.

**UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING**-Unsupervised learning (UL) is a type of algorithm that learns patterns from untagged data. The hope is that through mimicry, the machine is forced to build a compact internal representation of its world. In contrast to supervised learning (SL) where data is tagged by a human, e.g. as "car" or "fish" etc, UL exhibits self-organization that captures patterns as neuronal predilections or probability densities.

**REINFORCEMENT MACHINE LEARNING**-Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).
